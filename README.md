# Orynth
Organic Rhythm for Growth - Your study tracker app

## Deployment

This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the Angular project to Firebase Hosting. The project targets Angular CLI v20, which requires Node.js v20 or newer.
Pushes to the `main` branch run the workflow in `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting.yml`, which
builds the project from the `Orynth` directory and deploys it using the service account defined in
`secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.

## Local setup

Before running Angular CLI commands such as `ng serve` or `npm run build`, install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd Orynth
npm ci
```

This installs `@angular/cli` locally so the `ng` command is available.
